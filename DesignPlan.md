# Vibe Writer

## Core Concept

An AI-powered writing assistant designed to support long-form storytelling by providing context-aware writing tools and ensuring consistency across a manuscript.

## Motivation

The lack of native IDE-like support for AI in story writing and generation. Since writers likely lack programming knowledge, there’s a lot of missing optimizations that can be implemented in their workflows.

## Key Features

### Sentence Autocomplete

Provide real-time, context-sensitive suggestions to help writers maintain flow and overcome blocks.

### Referencing Previous Text

Enable quick access to earlier chapters or sections to maintain continuity and consistency.

### Editable Story Memory

Maintain a dynamic, user-adjustable repository of characters, plots, settings, and themes that the AI uses to contextualize suggestions and edits.

### Refactoring Tools

- **Large-Scale:** Allow for global changes (e.g., renaming characters, adjusting narrative tone throughout).
- **Small-Scale:** Offer local modifications (e.g., tweaking a scene’s mood or a character’s voice).

### Tone & Style Emulation

Analyze the user’s writing style over time to provide suggestions that match the established tone and voice.

### Integrated Knowledge Base/Graph

Create and query a structured map of story elements, enhancing the AI's understanding and consistency checks throughout the narrative.

### Edit History and Context Awareness

Be able to track the edit history of the story and use it to provide context-aware suggestions (recent deletions, additions, etc.)

## Implementation Approach

### Initial Prototype

Start with a minimal, focused interface (e.g., using a Monaco Editor embedded in a Streamlit app) to quickly test and iterate on UX features.

### User Control

Allow writers to toggle AI features on/off and edit the underlying story memory, ensuring that the tool adapts to their workflow rather than dictating changes.

### Scalability

Plan for future extensions like collaborative editing and advanced querying, while beginning with robust core functionalities tailored specifically for long-form narrative development.

## Extension Ideas

### Collaborative Editing

- Real-time, multi-author support with conflict resolution and version control.
- Integrated commenting, feedback, and chat for team collaboration.

### Advanced Knowledge Integration

- Integration with external databases or APIs (e.g., literary encyclopedias) for enriched context.
- Dynamic knowledge graph visualization that evolves as story elements are added or modified.

### Accessibility and Multimodal Inputs

- Voice-to-text and text-to-voice capabilities.
- Support for sketching out ideas (e.g., storyboarding or mind mapping alongside text).

### Idea Generation and Brainstorming Tools

- AI-driven brainstorming mode to generate plot ideas or character arcs.
- Alternate draft generation to explore “what-if” scenarios.

### Enhanced Revision and History Management

- Detailed version history with branching and rollback options.
- Integrated annotation and note-taking system for tracking changes and ideas.
