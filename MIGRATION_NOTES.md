# Migration from Streamlit to FastAPI/Next.js

This document describes the migration of Vibe Writer from a Streamlit application to a FastAPI backend with a Next.js/TypeScript frontend.

## Overview of Changes

### Architecture Changes

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Split the application into:

   - A backend API (FastAPI) for data management and business logic
   - A frontend UI (Next.js) for user interaction and display

2. **API-First Design**: Implemented a RESTful API with endpoints for:

   - Project management
   - Content management
   - Edit history tracking
   - Deletion history and restoration

3. **Modern Frontend**: Used Next.js with TypeScript for:
   - Type safety and improved developer experience
   - Component-based architecture
   - Client-side routing and state management

### Technical Improvements

1. **Enhanced Editor**: Upgraded from Streamlit's Monaco implementation to a direct integration with Monaco Editor through `@monaco-editor/react`

   - Better performance
   - More configurable options
   - Improved event handling

2. **Type Safety**: Added TypeScript for:

   - API models and responses
   - Component props and state
   - Event handling

3. **Styling Improvements**: Implemented TailwindCSS for:

   - Consistent dark theme
   - Responsive design
   - Component-specific styling

4. **Improved State Management**: Moved from Streamlit's session state to React's useState and useEffect

### Feature Preservation

All core features from the Streamlit application were preserved:

1. **Project Management**: Creating and switching between projects
2. **Monaco Editor**: Rich text editing with syntax highlighting
3. **Edit History**: Tracking and displaying edits and deletions
4. **Auto-save**: Automatic saving of content with edit tracking
5. **Content Management**: Loading and saving project content

### New Features

2. **Enhanced Edit History**: More detailed view of changes with expansion panels
3. **Responsive Design**: Better support for different screen sizes
4. **Performance Improvements**: Faster loading and editing experience
5. **Containerization**: Docker support for easier deployment
